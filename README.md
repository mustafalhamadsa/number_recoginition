# Number recognition with GUI
Draw a number for it to be recognized!
Dataset used is sklearn MNIST which is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original datasets

Calculated metrics with the test set are:
loss: 0.0647 - accuracy: 0.9814
